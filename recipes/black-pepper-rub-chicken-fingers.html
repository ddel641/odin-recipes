    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>
        Saucy, oven-baked Black Pepper Rub Chicken Fingers with Greek Yogurt 
        Ranch. These chicken tenders are GOOD! Coated in a mix of spicy 
        seasoned crumbs, oven-baked, then tossed in a spicy-hot black pepper 
        sauce. Follow these up with a delicious cooling ranch for dipping. 
        These sauced up chicken fingers are loved by all…kids and adults. And 
        yes, they’re even healthier (they’re baked, not fried), and so much 
        tastier. Serve with oven baked french fries and veggies for an easy 
        dinner that’s different, saucy, spicy, and beyond good!

        <li>2 tablespoon buttermilk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh chopped chives</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon dried dill</li>

        <li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>kosher salt and black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            In a bowl, combine the chicken, buttermilk, and 2 tablespoons hot 
            sauce. Toss well to coat.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with 
            parchment.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the corn flakes crumbs, cheese cracker crumbs (if using), 1 
            tablespoon fajita seasoning, and a large pinch of pepper to a 
            medium-size bowl. Stir to combine.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove each piece of chicken from the buttermilk, and dredge 
            through the crumbs, pressing gently to adhere. Place on the 
            prepared baking sheet. Repeat until all the chicken has been used. 
            Make sure not to crowd your pan, if necessary use two baking 
            sheets. Lightly brush/drizzle the chicken with olive oil. Transfer 
            to the oven and bake for 15-20 minutes or until the chicken is 
            cooked through.
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, make the black pepper sauce. Stir together the melted 
            butter, 1/2 cup hot sauce, 2 teaspoons fajita seasoning, and a 
            pinch black pepper (to your taste).
        </li>
        <li>
            To make the ranch, combine all ingredients in a bowl or glass jar. 
            Taste, adding salt and pepper as needed.
        </li>
        <li>
            Drizzle the chicken with the black pepper sauce. Serve alongside 
            the ranch for dipping. ENJOY.
