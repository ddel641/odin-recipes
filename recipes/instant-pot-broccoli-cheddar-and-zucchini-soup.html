        Panera! It’s cozy, but healthy, easy, and so delicious. Grab a couple 
        heads of broccoli, some zucchini, and sharp cheddar cheese, add 
        everything to your instant pot (or slow cooker), set the timer, and in 
        under thirty minutes you’ll have the creamiest, most delicious bowl of 
        cozy broccoli cheddar soup. Trust me, this will become a new fall

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <h4>Instant Pot</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Set Instant pot to sauté. Add the butter, olive oil, and onion, 
            cook 5 minutes or until fragrant. Add the carrots, zucchini, thyme, 
            nutmeg, cayenne and a large pinch each of salt and pepper. Pour in 
            the broth. Add the broccoli and bay leaves. Cover, select the manual
            setting, and cook on high pressure for 8 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once done cooking, use the quick release function and release the 
            steam. Carefully remove the bay leaves and discard. Transfer the soup 
            to a blender and pulse until chunky smooth (not totally puréed). 
            Return to the instant pot.
        </li>
        <li>
            Set the Instant pot to sauté. Stir in the milk and cheese, and 
            cook 5 minutes or until the cheese has melted. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Ladle the soup into bowls and top with fresh thyme. Enjoy!
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Slow Cooker</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            To the slow cooker, add the butter, olive oil, onion, carrots, 
            zucchini, thyme, nutmeg, cayenne and large pinch each of salt and 
            pepper. Stir to combine. Pour in the broth. Add the broccoli and 
            bay leaves. Cover, cook on high for 3-4 hours or low for 4-6 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once done cooking, carefully remove the bay leaves and discard. 
            Transfer the soup to a blender and pulse until chunky smooth (not 
            totally pureed). Return to the slow cooker and turn the heat to 
            high.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir in the milk and cheese, and cook 10 minutes or until the cheese 
            has melted.
