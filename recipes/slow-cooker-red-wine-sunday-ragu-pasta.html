    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <h4>Slow Cooker</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Season the short ribs with salt and pepper. Cook the bacon in a 
            large skillet over medium heat until crisp, about 5 minutes. Remove 
            the bacon. If there's excess bacon grease, drain off all but 1 
            tablespoon. Add the short ribs and sear on both sides. Remove the 
            ribs and transfer to the slow cooker along with the bacon.
        </li>
        <li>
            To the slow cooker, add the parmesan rind, wine, broth, tomatoes, 
            tomato paste, onion, garlic, celery, carrot, thyme, sage, red pepper
             flakes, 4 tablespoons butter, and season with salt and pepper. 
             Cover and cook on low for 6-8 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once done cooking, remove the short ribs, let cool slightly, then 
            shred the meat and discard the bones, parmesan rind, and thyme. Add 
            the shredded meat and parmesan, toss with the sauce. Keep on warm.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta 
            according to package directions until al dente. Drain and toss the 
            pasta with 4 tablespoons butter.
        </li>
        <li>
            Divide the pasta between plates, add the ragù, and toss well. 
            Top each serving with burrata and additional parmesan. 
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Instant Pot</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Season the short ribs with salt and pepper. Cook the bacon in a 
            large skillet over medium heat until crisp, about 5 minutes. Remove 
            the bacon. If there's excess bacon grease, drain off all but 1 
            tablespoon. Add the short ribs to the skillet and sear on both 
            sides. Remove the ribs and transfer to the instant pot along with 
            the bacon.
        </li>
        <li>
            To the instant pot, add the parmesan rind, wine, broth, tomatoes, 
            tomato paste, onion, garlic, celery, carrot, thyme, sage, red 
            pepper flakes, 4 tablespoons butter, and season with salt and 
            pepper. Cover and cook on high pressure for 40 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once done cooking, use the natural or quick release function. 
            Remove the short ribs, let cool slightly, then shred the meat and 
            discard the bones.
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, set the Instant pot to sauté. Bring to a boil, boil 5-10 
            minutes or until the liquid reduces just slightly. Turn the instant 
            pot off. Remove the thyme and parmesan rind and discard. Add the 
            shredded meat and parmesan, toss with the sauce. Keep on warm.
        </li>
        <li>
            Finish as directed above for the slow cooker.
        </li>
